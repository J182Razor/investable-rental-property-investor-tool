## Sprint 1: Part 1 -- Project Update

### I have completed my MVP (yes/no): no

### I have completed these features for my MVP:

implemented all main view functions: logging, register, cash flow calculator, google map API, news API

### This coming week, I plan to work on:

blog, comment, add properties from calculator, find a substitute for goodreads API because this API has been retired since mid 2020

### My general work plan/estimate for the rest of Sprint 1:

<ul>
<li> Add blogging feature </li>
<li> Add commenting feature </li>
<li> Add profile pix option</li>
<li> Add property comparison feature </li>
<li> Chart.JS </li>
<li> Some book API </li>
</ul>
