"Considering hiring a property manager in St Pete, FL (50+ units)","I used to be very active on here and although I stopped actively buying 4 years ago I still have a large number of rentals in the St Pete area.  I am looking for suggestions for an exceptional property manager in the area.  I have been self managing with a couple of employees that handle all maintenance and rehabs but I've been busy with other business interests so I am considering outsourcing the management.   I have mostly single family plus some small multis in the 2-5 unit range, 40+ properties with 50+ doors.   If you know an amazing property manager in the area please let me know.  All of my properties are in South Pinellas and prefer someone based in St Pete with experience in South St Pete (about half of my properties are in that area, the other half are north St Pete, Gulfport and Pinellas Park) "
Screening Your Own Tenant w/ Property Management Company,"I have property that i have recently rehabbed and that I am about to being marketing for tenants through my PM. While I am a big fan of using a PM for day to day activities, the first month's rent that is charged for tenant screening and placement takes a huge chunk out of my ROI calculation. I am curious how often investors have had luck placing their own tenants and bringing in a PM once the tenant is in place. I cant see a company turning down a contract because it doesn't have the cherry on top, but would be curious how many would pass on that offer."
Shared Utilities - best way to divide costs,"Hi all - we have an ADU in our single family home and have been including the cost of utilities in the ADU rent. We recently started charging our tenants a $100 flat rate to help cover some of our soaring utility costs here in San Diego. We are moving out of state in a few months and plan to rent out the house and keep our same tenants in the ADU. What is the best way to split the costs of the bills between tenants? The main house is about 1100 SF and the ADU is 500 SF. The main house has 3 bed/1.5 baths, washer/dryer. The ADU has a stackable washer dryer, 1 bath. Both have only one gas wall heating unit. 2 tenants in the ADU and not sure how many we will have in the main house. I am hesitant to charge a flat rate because it doesn't incentivize people to be mindful of energy use. Maybe 1/3 to ADU and 2/3 to main house? Or should we go by # of tenants per unit? Thanks for any suggestions!"
"Purchased duplex, 1 year and $20k later found out it's zoned SF","So I purchased a ""duplex"" listing says duplex, agent says duplex, all of the paper work says multi-family and the disclosers say no zoning issues, passes inspection, even comes with both units rented. Turns out only zoned/permitted for SF. Undisclosed to me the MLS has agent notes stating that this is actually an SF with ADU, but they are leaving it up to buyers to investigate for themselves."
PM tools with full-service maintenance and leasing capability,"We are looking at some full-scale PM solution that could not only help with rent collection/accounting etc. but also help us with leasing/showing services, maintenance request management (receiving phone calls, logging requests, scheduling activities within local vendor network and ensuring closure of activities) activities."

"Best advice to maximize cash flow for life, with inheriting $1.8M","I am looking for the best advice in regards to how to invest $1.8M from an inheritance.Part of the clause of the inheritance reads, all the proceeds would go into a Trust between (2) family members, the inheritor and his niece,where the inheritor (who is married)gets 100% use of the inheritance & when they die, all the proceeds go onto to the niece."
"Made a mistake in purchase contract, how do I correct it?","Hey guys. So my wife and Iare in the process of buying a home for ourselves. We have one investment property, but this is the first home for ourselves. The listing price for this was 320k, but we ended up getting it for 362k with buyer knowledge inspection and 25k appraisal gap. With the market being this crazy, we knew something this aggressive is only what's going to get us into the running. According to our agent, there were multiple offers and everything, but they ended up taking ours as it was the best. One of the other things we were okay with and was in the contract is a possession clause. So we have set the closing date to first week of June and we're going to take possession first week of July. Now this is where we messed up...we were under the impression that even after closing, the owners would pay for everything until we take possession. I just found out his wasn't the case talking with family and my loan officer. So as the contract is written, we're giving these guys essentially free stay (they only pay utilities) until they move out, which is June 25, so end of month essentially. This was not explained to us by our agent and we were okay with this because we thought they'd be paying for everything until we take possession. Currently we've done inspections and all came clean and the bank just converted the loan over to this property this week. What should we do now? Talking to the agent, he's like this is what got you guys this deal and going back would kill the deal and etc? I want to believe my agent, but we actually have talked to the owner as we ran into them during inspection and realized that some of the stuff they felt (eg. such as things they want to leave behind for us) was not the same as what we got back from our agent when we asked them. And conversing with the owners we think was a much better experience."
Newbie Question: Fixer upper from a Distance,Is getting a fixer upper and relying on the PM company to get contractors and source it out a good plan? Provided the PM company is good of course. Or is it better to just get properties that dont need work since we wont be there to over see projects? A slight fixer upper sounds great but Im not sure if its smart to trust others to fix it up for you. Anyone have experience doing this? 
Market of the Moment - 5/13/2022,"Friday the 13th, oooooooooo spooky! You know what isn't spooky? HAVING MORE INVENTORY. We are approaching 400 homes on the market in Salt Lake County under 700,000. Considering we were under 200 earlier this year, that is something to celebrate if you are a buyer. My experience with my last couple of listings (I usually list 2-3 houses per month) is that we are getting less offers but the winning offers are still very strong."

Our First Investment Property - One year later,"We started self-educating about REI in Dec 2020 and by Jan 2021, stumbled upon a friend who was in the process of buying a new home, which was contingent on selling their current home. After looking it over and running the numbers, we agreed to purchase it for $125k directly with no agents. Because the seller was able to avoid incurring additional costs to make the home ready to sell as well as avoiding commission fees. It was a solid first investment opportunity, capable of meeting the 1% rule."
