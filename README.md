Real estate investing is fantastic way to create wealth and build a stream of passive income. Having been a real estate investor with a background in property accounting for numerous years, I have always wanted to build a tool that would assist new investors with their decision making and investing journey.<br> 
<br>
* Catculator is a research tool for investors looking to make a quick decision whether a rental property is a good investment.
* This app allows users to input data and run the numbers quickly to see if a property is generating positive cash flows given your estimates of rental income and expenses are accurate.
* It also allows users to ask questions, share knowledge and network through a community dashboard feature.
* Users can also enrich their skills by industry insight and book recommedation API features.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
