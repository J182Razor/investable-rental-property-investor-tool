Real estate investing is fantastic way to create wealth and build a stream of passive income. Having been a real estate investor with a background in property accounting for numerous years, I have always wanted to build a tool that would assist new investors with their decision making and investing journey. Catculator is a research tool for investors looking to make a quick decision whether a rental property is a good investment. This app allows users to input data and run the numbers quickly to see if a property is generating positive cash flows given your estimates of rental income and expenses are accurate. It also allows users to ask questions, share knowledge and network through a community dashboard feature. Users can also enrich their skills by industry insight and book recommedation API features.
